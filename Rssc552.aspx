To receive a Parent Portal account Activation Key, bring a photo identification to your child's school or the Almon C. Hill Educational Center located at 136 Almon C. Hill Drive (recent street name change from 136 Elm Street), Cumming, GA. Refer to the Records Department website for Hill Center hours of operation: <a href="http://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/page/1514">http://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/page/1514</a><br /><br />2. When you receive your Activation Key, you can create an account for Parent Portal at the following link: <a href="https://campus.forsyth.k12.ga.us/campus/portal/forsyth.jsp?section=activate">https://campus.forsyth.k12.ga.us/campus/portal/forsyth.jsp?section=activate</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />3. Parent Portal accounts created before 7:00 PM will be uploaded overnight into itslearning. The next day, return to this itslearning login page and send an email to <a href="mailto:clittle@forsyth.k12.ga.us">clittle@forsyth.k12.ga.us</a>. This will initiate an email to a staff member to complete your account activation process. Upon activation you will receive an email to reset your itslearning password.<br /><br />Thank you for your support of Forsyth County Schools!<br /><br />What to expect once you log in:<br /><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/71456463" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/71456463">Parent Video</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user19302222">Jason Naile</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><br /><br /><br />]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 12:13:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">0X2174X8</guid></item></channel></rss>
